         <p id="testP" class="funParagraph">Last weekend I went on a trip to Austin Texas with my group of friends for a convention called Dreamcon. Dreamcon is a black anime convention where there are event rooms, artist tabling, and cosplay competitiond.
            I went with a group of friends who are all passionate about anime and who are artists themselves. This was my first Dreamcon and I can say it went beyond my expectations of how fun it was. Also for next year's Dreamcon
            I definitely will put more effort into my cosplay!

         <h2>Vegan Food</h2>
      <p>
         As a vegan and a foodie, I always like to check out new vegan restaurants wherever I travel to. I did not know Austing was such a health conscious city, and I definitely appreciate it since I had so many 
         options to choose from. I have been craving quality tacos for a long time especially since I don't prefer St Louis' food scene. After trying out Austin's vegan cuisine, I felt spoilded coming back to St Louis.
         This trip inspires me to travel more so I can eat even better vegan cuisine.

         <h2>Weebz</h2>
      <p>I started out illustrating since I was two years old and had an interest in animation not too soon after. I was fascinated how my drawings could end up on a tv screen in motion! I took an interest in anime around middle
         school with shows such as: Bleach, Naruto, and Dragon Ball Z. In the black community anime is seen as such an expression of oneself that it united all of us to come together in another city because of it.
